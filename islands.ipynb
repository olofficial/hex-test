    "Electron Beam Melting is usually done using line melting patterns. A problem that arises with line melting is powder transport, when the electron beam pushes the powder ahead of itself. This causes internal stress, component warping and uneven surfaces, all obviously unwanted consequences. This issue is correlated with the line length, so larger components are more susceptible to powder transport. One way to mitigate this is to implement what is called an *island melting* strategy, where the build area is partitioned into a grid of overlapping rectangles, called *islands*. These islands are then subsequently melted one at a time in a certain order, varieties of which will be implemented in this guide. \n",
